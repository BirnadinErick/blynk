# Security 💂‍♂️

### Privacy Notice

`blynk` is a minimal and **just** works. Thus, no telemetry or anything. It even 
doesn't net-ping at all. 

> Your privacy is at your rist. Only download from the project's release page
> and be with the supported version

### Supported version

This is a dead-simple program. Thus, only the latest version is supported and actively
maintained to create new version. And the project uses [SemVer](https://semver.org/).

**Note**: Here ***latest*** version actually regards any **major/minor** version. 
Each revision doesn't count.

i.e. when the project's ***latest*** is of version v1.3.2...

| version | is supported? |
| :---: | :---: |
| v1.2.3 | 🚫|
| v1.3.1 | 🆗|
| v1.3.2| ✅ |

So, be in the know that the new minor version is available is for a reason. 

>And, please make sure to visit the [README](/README.md) for any critical security
>updates!
